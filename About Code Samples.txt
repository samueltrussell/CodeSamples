These projects represent some of my sole-contributor coding in java and C++

Hunter Seeker:

This project was undertaken as an introductory learning project for java and OOD. The background motivation
for the project was the development of a robust Extended Kalman Filter for state estimation in a simulated 
robot with extremely noisy sensor measurements (up to ~2x measurement value) in pursuing and capturing a
second robot with an unknown trajectory (circular, constant speed motion in this example). This project was
inspired by an AI for Robotics course offered in Python through Udacity.com, and the matrix math library was
ported from python source code offered as part of that course.

MonsterEngine:

This project is an ongoing game engine development project undertaken as part of my Master's degree at the 
University of Utah. Executed in native C++, this project serves as a means of learning Game Engine Architecture
through implementation. There is a good deal of code here implenting custom memory management, basic physics
game object life-cycle management etc. All of the contained code is mine, written as the sole contributor except
for the code in the GLib and Lua libraries which are included as externally linked repositories and built into
static libraries as part of the project.
